    "In a monastery in the deepest parts of Tibet there are three crystal columns and 64 golden rings. The rings are different sizes and rest over the columns. At the beginning of time, all of the rings rested on the leftmost column, and since then the monks have toiled ceaselessly trying to perfectly transfer the rings to their resting place on the final column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this problem is to move the entire stack of rings from the first, to the last column, while obeying 3 simple rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tOnly one ring can be moved at time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tEach move consists of taking the upper ring from one of the stacks and placing it on the top of another stack or an empty pole.\n",
